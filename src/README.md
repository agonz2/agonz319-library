# Overview
This package implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and the Heap queue algorithm. Heaps are useful data structures for implementing priority queues efficiently, which are often used in algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path, where you need to quickly find and remove the smallest (or largest) element.

# Features
  **Heap Queue (`heapq.py`)**: 
    Efficient heap-based priority queue operations.
    Functions include `heappush`, `heappop`, `heapreplace`, `merge`, `nlargest`, and `nsmallest`.
  
  **Shortest Path (`sp.py`)**:
    Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.
    Functions include:
    `dijkstra(graph, source)`: Computes the shortest path from the source to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
